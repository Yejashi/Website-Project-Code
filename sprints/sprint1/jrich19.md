# Sprint 1
- Josephine Rich
- jrichcodes
- Trip Planner

### What I Planned To Do
- [Create Trip Summary Page](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/5)
- [Add TripTypes and gearItems in database tables](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/16)
- [Create basic database link for trip summary page](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/12)
- [Link trip summary to home page](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/10)

### What I Didn't Do
- I completed 3/4 issues assigned to me. The issue of "link trip summary to home page" doesn't apply anymore because that's not
part of the user experience. The user would have to go to the events page first before seeing a trip summary page. Therefore, I
didn't complete this issue.

### Problems Encountered
- formatting thing in html and boostrap to make things look pretty
- learning how to write to a database and extract information from a database
- trying to work on things that js tied to other teamates work that isn't complete yet

### Issues I Worked On
- [Issue 5](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/5)
- [Issue 16](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/16)
- [Issue 12](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/12)

### Files I Worked On
- project_template/website/auth.py
- project_template/website/templates/trip_summary.html
- project_template/website/database.db

- created a table in the database for gear items
- created a table for trip types in the database
- added models for trip types and gear items
